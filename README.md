Implementation of **Fuzzy Algorithms** using [**SciKit**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Fuzzy Algorithms are algorithms that use [**fuzzy logic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) to gain results based on degree of certainty rather than true/false relations.

Fuzzy logic has been applied to many fields, from [**control theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) to [**artificial intelligence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).
